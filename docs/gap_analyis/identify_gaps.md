# Gap Analysis: IDENTIFY

## Overview
This document identifies gaps in CyberTech Inc.'s asset and risk management practices and outlines actions to close them.

## Gaps
1. **Asset Management (ID.AM-01, ID.AM-02)**:
   - **Current State**: Partial hardware inventory; no software or service inventory.
   - **Target State**: Maintain complete inventories of hardware, software, and services.
   - **Impact**: Lack of visibility increases risk of unmanaged vulnerabilities.
   - **Action Plan**: Complete asset inventories by Q2 2024.

2. **Risk Assessment (ID.RA-04)**:
   - **Current State**: Ad-hoc risk assessments; no standardized process.
   - **Target State**: Conduct quarterly risk assessments using NIST SP 800-30.
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent risk assessments lead to unaddressed vulnerabilities.
   - **Action Plan**: Conduct first quarterly risk assessment by Q3 2024.

3. **Improvement (ID.IM-01)**:
   - **Current State**: No structured process for identifying improvements.
   - **Target State**: Implement a structured improvement process.
   - **Impact**: Missed opportunities to enhance cybersecurity posture.
   - **Action Plan**: Establish improvement processes by Q4 2024.

## Key Metrics
- Complete and up-to-date asset inventories.
- Quarterly risk assessments conducted.
- Improvement processes documented and implemented.
