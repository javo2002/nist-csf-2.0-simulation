# Tier 3: Repeatable

## Overview
CyberTech Inc. aims to achieve **Tier 3 (Repeatable)** by 2026. At this Tier, cybersecurity practices are formalized, standardized, and consistently applied.

## Key Goals
1. **Governance**:  
   - Integrate cybersecurity risks into enterprise risk management (ERM) (Target: Q2 2024).  
   - Conduct quarterly reviews of cybersecurity performance (Target: Q2 2024).  

2. **Risk Management**:  
   - Automate asset and patch management (Target: Q4 2024).  
   - Conduct regular tabletop exercises for incident response (Target: Q4 2024).  

3. **Communication**:  
   - Share cybersecurity information routinely across the organization (Target: Q3 2024).  

## Evidence
- ERM integration and quarterly reviews documented (see `target_profile/govern.md`).  
- Automated patch management and tabletop exercises implemented (see `target_profile/protect.md` and `target_profile/respond.md`).  

## Next Steps
- Implement advanced monitoring tools (e.g., AI-driven threat detection).  
- Progress to **Tier 4 (Adaptive)** by 2028.
