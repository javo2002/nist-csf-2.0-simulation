# Tier 1: Partial

## Overview
CyberTech Inc. is currently at **Tier 1 (Partial)**. Cybersecurity practices are ad-hoc and inconsistently applied.

## Key Characteristics
1. **Governance**:  
   - No formal cybersecurity policy or strategy.  
   - Cybersecurity risks are not integrated into enterprise risk management (ERM).  

2. **Risk Management**:  
   - Limited awareness of cybersecurity risks at the organizational level.  
   - No standardized processes for risk assessment or mitigation.  

3. **Communication**:  
   - Cybersecurity information is not routinely shared within the organization.  

## Evidence
- Lack of formal policies and roles (see `current_profile/govern.md`).  
- Partial asset inventory and ad-hoc risk assessments (see `current_profile/identify.md`).  

## Next Steps
- Develop a formal cybersecurity policy (Target: Q1 2024).  
- Complete asset inventories and conduct risk assessments (Target: Q2 2024).  
- Progress to **Tier 2 (Risk Informed)** by end of 2024.
