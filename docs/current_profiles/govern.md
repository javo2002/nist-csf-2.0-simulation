# Current Profile: GOVERN

## Overview
The GOVERN Function establishes and monitors the organization's cybersecurity strategy, expectations, and policy. Currently, CyberTech Inc. lacks formal governance structures.

## Key Gaps
1. **Policy (GV.PO-01)**:
   - No formal cybersecurity policy exists.
   - Cybersecurity expectations are not clearly communicated.
2. **Roles and Responsibilities (GV.RR-02)**:
   - Roles for cybersecurity (e.g., incident lead) are informal and undocumented.
   - No clear accountability for cybersecurity risks.
3. **Risk Management Strategy (GV.RM-01)**:
   - Cybersecurity risks are not integrated into enterprise risk management (ERM).
   - No standardized method for calculating or prioritizing risks.
4. **Oversight (GV.OV-01)**:
   - No regular reviews of cybersecurity performance or strategy.

## Evidence
- Interviews with IT Manager and HR Director.
- Review of existing documentation (e.g., employee handbook).

## Next Steps
- Develop a formal cybersecurity policy.
- Define and communicate roles and responsibilities.
- Integrate cybersecurity risks into ERM processes.
