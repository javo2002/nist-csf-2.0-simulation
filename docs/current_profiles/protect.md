# Current Profile: PROTECT

## Overview
The PROTECT Function focuses on implementing safeguards to manage cybersecurity risks. CyberTech Inc. has limited safeguards in place.

## Key Gaps
1. **Access Control (PR.AA-03)**:
   - No multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged accounts.
   - Weak password policies.
2. **Data Security (PR.DS-11)**:
   - Backups exist but are untested.
   - No encryption for sensitive data at rest or in transit.
3. **Awareness and Training (PR.AT-01)**:
   - No mandatory cybersecurity training for employees.
4. **Platform Security (PR.PS-01)**:
   - No formal configuration management practices.

## Evidence
- IT Manager confirmed lack of MFA and weak password policies.
- No records of backup testing or encryption implementation.

## Next Steps
- Enforce MFA for all privileged accounts.
- Test backups quarterly and implement encryption.
- Develop and deliver cybersecurity training for employees.
