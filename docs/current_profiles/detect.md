# Current Profile: DETECT

## Overview
The DETECT Function focuses on identifying potential cybersecurity events. CyberTech Inc. has limited monitoring capabilities.

## Key Gaps
1. **Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM-01)**:
   - No network monitoring tools (e.g., SIEM) in place.
   - No centralized logging or alerting.
2. **Adverse Event Analysis (DE.AE-02)**:
   - No process for analyzing anomalies or indicators of compromise.

## Evidence
- IT Manager confirmed lack of monitoring tools.
- No documented incident detection processes.

## Next Steps
- Deploy a SIEM tool for network monitoring.
- Establish centralized logging and alerting.
- Develop processes for analyzing adverse events.
