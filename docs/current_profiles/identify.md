# Current Profile: IDENTIFY

## Overview
The IDENTIFY Function focuses on understanding the organization's assets and cybersecurity risks. CyberTech Inc. has limited visibility into its assets and risks.

## Key Gaps
1. **Asset Management (ID.AM-01, ID.AM-02)**:
   - Partial hardware inventory; no software or service inventory.
   - No prioritization of assets based on criticality.
2. **Risk Assessment (ID.RA-04)**:
   - Ad-hoc risk assessments; no standardized process.
   - No formal vulnerability management program.
3. **Improvement (ID.IM-01)**:
   - No structured process for identifying and implementing improvements.

## Evidence
- IT Manager provided a partial hardware inventory.
- No documented risk assessments or vulnerability scans.

## Next Steps
- Create a complete inventory of hardware, software, and services.
- Implement a standardized risk assessment process.
- Establish a vulnerability management program.
