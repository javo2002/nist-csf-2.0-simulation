# Project Objectives

## Primary Objectives
1. **Assess Current State**: Create a Current Profile documenting CyberTech Inc.'s existing cybersecurity practices.
2. **Define Desired State**: Develop a Target Profile outlining desired cybersecurity outcomes.
3. **Identify Gaps**: Conduct a gap analysis to identify areas for improvement.
4. **Plan Tier Progression**: Develop a roadmap to progress from Tier 1 (Partial) to Tier 2 (Risk Informed) and beyond.

## Secondary Objectives
1. **Engage Stakeholders**: Collaborate with friends (acting as stakeholders) to gather input and align cybersecurity goals with business needs.
2. **Document Best Practices**: Use NIST CSF 2.0 to create reusable templates (e.g., risk register, incident response plan).
3. **Visualize Progress**: Create diagrams and charts to explain NIST CSF concepts and project outcomes.

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive understanding of NIST CSF 2.0.
- A documented cybersecurity improvement plan for CyberTech Inc.
- Reusable templates and visual aids for future projects.
